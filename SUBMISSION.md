## Summary
YieldAgent is a fully autonomous AI LP manager on X Layer. A user states their goal in plain English ("earn yield on 500 USDT, moderate risk"), and three cooperating brains — Market, Pool, and Risk — produce a concrete strategy. Range math is delegated to a TypeScript port of Uniswap's official `liquidity-planner@0.2.0` AI Skill, so every tick bound is provably the same one the skill would hand a human LP. Those ranges are then used as **directional trigger bands** for a swap-based rebalancer: when spot crosses above the upper band the agent sells the volatile side back to USDT, when it crosses below it buys. Every DEX tx flows through OnchainOS's `swap execute` command, signed inside the Agentic Wallet TEE — exactly the path the "Most Active On-Chain Agent" anti-gaming rule requires. Every DEPLOY / REBALANCE / COMPOUND / HOLD / EXIT decision, along with its reasoning chain and confidence score, is anchored to the on-chain `StrategyManager` + `DecisionLogger` audit trail so judges and copy-trading followers can reconstruct the agent's thinking at every block height.

## What I Built

Three layers, each chosen to map directly to a hackathon scoring dimension:

1. **Planning brain** — a three-model ensemble (`MarketBrain`, `PoolBrain`, `RiskBrain`) that takes a pool and a user intent and outputs (a) a target tick range, (b) rebalance urgency, (c) an emergency exit flag, and (d) a natural-language thesis. Range math is not hand-rolled — `PoolBrain.analyze()` calls `UniswapSkillsAdapter.classifyPairType()` + `computeRangeCandidates()`, which is a verbatim TypeScript port of the `liquidity-planner@0.2.0` Claude Code skill (width table, fee-tier → tick-spacing map, and pair-type classification rules ported 1:1 from `SKILL.md` Steps 6–7 and `references/position-types.md`). Every `PoolAnalysis.reasoning` string closes with a citation back to the skill version + source URL so the on-chain audit trail can be traced to the upstream methodology.

2. **Execution layer** — `OnchainOSAdapter` wraps the `onchainos` v2.2.7 CLI via `child_process.execFile`. Every write path in `AgentCoordinator` (`deployStrategy`, the rebalance branch of `runFullEvaluation`, and the emergency-exit branch) routes through its `swap()` method, which maps onto `onchainos swap execute --from ... --to ... --wallet ...`: the CLI quotes the route via OKX DEX aggregator, performs any required ERC-20 approve, signs inside the Agentic Wallet TEE, and broadcasts as a plain EOA tx. The local process never holds a private key that could bypass OnchainOS. When `OKX_ACCESS_KEY` is unset the adapter auto-switches to simulate mode and returns mock tx hashes so frontend demos still work; the resolved mode (`live` | `simulated` | `audit-only`) is surfaced to the frontend on every `/api/deploy` response.

   **Why swap, not V3 `defi invest`?** On X Layer mainnet, `defi invest` (and `defi deposit`) return permit-based calldata routed through OKX's DEX Entrance contract at `0x7251FEbEABB01eC9dE53ECe7a96f1C951F886Dd2`. That calldata bundles a pre-signed EIP-712 permit designed for OKX's relayer infrastructure — it reverts with `execution reverted` when broadcast directly via `wallet contract-call`, because the Entrance contract's permit validation expects a specific msg.sender / relayer flow. We verified this against investmentId 42003 (USDT-OKB 0.3%) with explicit ticks, without ticks, and with freshly-regenerated calldata — all three reverted during `estimateGas`. Since YieldAgent's anti-gaming guarantee *requires* that every tx be signed inside the Agentic Wallet TEE (i.e. routed through `wallet contract-call` or `swap execute`, not the hosted relayer), the permit path is unusable. `swap execute` uses the OKX DEX aggregator router directly (via EntryPoint v0.7 bundling through the Agentic Wallet's ERC-4337 smart account), and has been verified working end-to-end on X Layer mainnet (see Proof of Work below: 6 real swap txs totalling ~$32 of directional volume).

   The trade-off is explicit: we give up V3 fee yield in exchange for an execution path that actually broadcasts. The range recommendations from `PoolBrain` + `UniswapSkillsAdapter` are still computed using the official `liquidity-planner@0.2.0` width table — they just drive *when* the agent swaps (cross-above → sell, cross-below → buy) rather than *where* it mints an NFT. The rebalance amount is capped at 10% of the current non-stable balance per trigger with a 3% heartbeat nudge when inside the range.

3. **On-chain audit layer** — three slim Solidity contracts (`StrategyManager` v2, `DecisionLogger`, `FollowVaultFactory`) store the full decision graph. Every action the agent takes, including HOLD decisions where it explicitly chose *not* to rebalance, is recorded with its reasoning, confidence, and the matching OnchainOS tx hash via `ExecutionEngine.recordExecution(params)`. `ExecutionEngine` itself never signs a DEX tx — it only anchors OnchainOS tx hashes on-chain, enforcing the invariant that the on-chain log cannot claim more activity than OnchainOS actually signed. Judges can scan a single address to reconstruct what the agent was thinking at every block height.

## How It Functions

**Trigger loop.** `AgentCoordinator` runs a two-tier monitor: a quick price-drift check every 5 minutes (`evaluationIntervalMs`), and a full three-brain re-evaluation every 30 minutes (`fullEvalIntervalMs`). A compound sweep runs every 6 hours (`compoundIntervalMs`). All three intervals are set in `agent/src/config/index.ts` so judges can verify the loop cadence.

**State.** Each active strategy lives in `StrategyManager._strategies[strategyId]` (metadata only — pool, tokens, fee tier, risk profile, owner, active flag). Every execution creates an `Execution` record with `{ timestamp, action, tickLower, tickUpper, txHash, externalId }` where `txHash` is the *OnchainOS* tx and `externalId` is the OnchainOS `investmentId`. AgentCoordinator maintains a per-strategy `StrategyContext` map that caches `investmentId` plus an opportunistically-resolved Uniswap V3 NFT `tokenId` (via `defi positions`) so subsequent rebalance / compound / exit calls can reference the position without re-searching.

**Transaction flow.**

**Rebalance flow.** On each full evaluation, `rebalanceViaOnchainOS`:
1. Reads live wallet balances via `OnchainOSAdapter.getBalance()` (wraps `onchainos wallet balance --chain 196`).
2. Compares spot price / current tick against the recommended range upper / lower bounds.
3. Chooses a direction: above range → `sell_non_stable` (10% of non-stable balance), below range → `buy_non_stable` (10% of stable balance), inside → 3% nudge toward the mid.
4. Dispatches a single `onchainos swap execute` with the chosen direction and readable amount.
5. Records the resulting `swapTxHash` via `recordExecution(ACTION_REBALANCE, …)`.

Every step is in `agent/src/services/AgentCoordinator.ts` — `rebalanceViaOnchainOS`, `exitViaOnchainOS`, `depositViaOnchainOS`.

No DEX tx bypasses OnchainOS — verifiable two ways:
1. Grep `agent/src/adapters/` — the only file that imports `execFile("onchainos", ...)` is `OnchainOSAdapter.ts`. `ExecutionEngine.ts` and `StrategyManager.sol` contain zero DEX-signing code.
2. Cross-reference `StrategyManager.getExecutions(strategyId)[i].txHash` with OnchainOS's own activity API — the hashes match 1:1 because `recordExecution` is only called with a real OnchainOS tx hash in its `txHash` field.

## OnchainOS / Uniswap Integration

- **OnchainOS modules used** (see `agent/src/adapters/OnchainOSAdapter.ts`)
  - **Agentic Wallet** — `wallet login --force`, `wallet addresses`, `wallet balance --chain 196`, `wallet status`
  - **DEX swap (primary execution path)** — `swap execute --from ... --to ... --wallet ... --chain 196 --readable-amount ... --slippage 0.5` — signs inside Agentic Wallet TEE, broadcasts via OKX DEX aggregator router; this is the one-shot path every real YieldAgent tx goes through
  - **DeFi read layer** — `defi search --product-group DEX_POOL`, `defi detail`, `defi support-chains`, `defi depth-price-chart`, `defi positions` (for investmentId resolution + audit-trail enrichment)
  - **DeFi write layer (kept for future relayer path)** — `defi invest`, `defi withdraw`, `defi collect` — wired in `OnchainOSAdapter.invest()`, but marked EXPERIMENTAL in the doc comment because the returned calldata is permit-based (see "Execution layer" above for full postmortem). Once OnchainOS exposes a relayer broadcast path, switching back to V3 mint requires only flipping one method call in `AgentCoordinator.depositViaOnchainOS`.
- **Uniswap AI Skills used** (see `agent/src/adapters/UniswapSkillsAdapter.ts`) — **two skills are live-loaded and runtime-cited**, not just referenced in docs. Judges can grep the `/api/health` response to see both skill versions in the `uniswapSkills[]` array, and grep `UniswapSkillsAdapter.ts` for `LIQUIDITY_PLANNER_SKILL` and `SWAP_PLANNER_SKILL` constants.
  - **`liquidity-planner@0.2.0`** — drives `PoolBrain.recommendedRanges` via `UniswapSkillsAdapter.computeRangeCandidates()`. Ported verbatim to TypeScript so the backend monitoring loop can use it without spawning a Claude Code sub-agent every 5 minutes. The adapter exports `LIQUIDITY_PLANNER_SKILL = { name, version, source, installedPath }` as a runtime citation, and every `PoolAnalysis.reasoning` string closes with `"Range math via liquidity-planner@0.2.0 (<github url>)."`. Ported constants (all 1:1 from the skill):
    - `FEE_TO_TICK_SPACING` — `{100:1, 500:10, 3000:60, 10000:200}` (`references/position-types.md`)
    - `PAIR_WIDTH_PERCENTS` — stablecoin ±0.5/1/2 %, correlated ±2/5/10 %, major ±10/20/50 %, volatile ±30/50/100 % (`SKILL.md` Step 6)
    - `FEE_TIER_BY_PAIR_TYPE` — stablecoin→100, correlated→500, major→3000, volatile→10000 (`SKILL.md` Step 7)
    - `STABLE_SYMBOLS`, `MAJOR_SYMBOLS`, `CORRELATED_PAIRS` — pair classification lists
  - **`swap-planner@0.1.0`** — drives every rebalance broadcast via `UniswapSkillsAdapter.planRebalanceSwap()`, invoked in `AgentCoordinator.rebalanceViaOnchainOS` **before** the OnchainOS `swap execute` call. For every swap the skill runs the full pipeline: pair classification → default slippage lookup → price-impact k-factor boost → slippage floor → derived `expectedOut` and `minOut` (as audit witnesses). The **slippage** value is the load-bearing output: it is the numeric string passed to `onchainos swap execute --slippage …`, so OnchainOS enforces on-chain revert-if-worse-than behavior using the slippage that `swap-planner` computed. The `expectedOut` / `minOut` numbers from the plan are logged alongside the real `toAmount` the CLI returns, so any divergence between the plan's witness values and the actual fill is visible in the agent logs and ends up in `DecisionLogger.reasoning`. The adapter exports `SWAP_PLANNER_SKILL = { name, version, source, installedPath }` as a runtime citation, and every `SwapPlan.reasoning` string embeds `swap-planner@0.1.0: <direction> (<pairType>, <liquidityBucket>) — default slippage X %, impact Y %, applied Z %` so DecisionLogger rows trace back to the exact skill revision. Ported constants (all 1:1 from the skill):
    - `SWAP_PLANNER_DEFAULT_SLIPPAGE` — stablecoin 0.1 %, correlated 0.3 %, major 0.5 %, volatile 1.0 % (Step 1 "slippage ladder")
    - `SWAP_PLANNER_IMPACT_K_FACTOR` — deep 1.0, moderate 1.5, thin 2.5, very_thin 4.0 (Step 2 "impact multiplier")
    - `SWAP_PLANNER_SLIPPAGE_FLOOR` — 0.05 % minimum headroom on top of `impact × 1.5` (Step 3)
    - `SWAP_PLANNER_SPLIT_THRESHOLD` — 0.5 % of pool TVL triggers optional split-swap plan (Step 5)
  - **How the two skills cooperate.** `liquidity-planner` computes the directional trigger bands (cross-above → `sell_non_stable`, cross-below → `buy_non_stable`); `swap-planner` turns that directional decision into a concrete `SwapPlan` with slippage and minOut sized for the live pool's liquidity bucket; that plan is then handed to `OnchainOSAdapter.swap(...)` for TEE-signed broadcast. The same `liquidity-planner` width table and fee-tier map that would drive a V3 NFT mint decision now drives the trigger side, and `swap-planner` covers the execution-side questions — both Uniswap methodologies stay load-bearing even though the execution surface changed from `defi invest` to `swap execute`.

## Proof of Work

YieldAgent uses **two separate signers** for physical separation of audit and execution:

- **OnchainOS Agentic Wallet** (signs every DEX tx, TEE-controlled): `0x6ab27b82890bc85cd996f518173487ece9811d61`
  - Assigned by OnchainOS on first `wallet login`, account id `04c9d299-9e85-4c20-98c5-8f1f2a4bba36`
  - Mainnet tx history: [OKLink mainnet](https://www.oklink.com/xlayer/address/0x6ab27b82890bc85cd996f518173487ece9811d61)
  - **This is the wallet the "Most Active On-Chain Agent" prize judges should point their activity tracking at** — every `onchainos swap execute` tx on X Layer during the hackathon window is signed here inside the OnchainOS TEE, never by our local process. The 6 verified swap txs in the "Mainnet on-chain activity" table below all originate from this address.

- **Audit / registry signer** (signs `StrategyManager.deployStrategy`, `recordExecution`, `logDecision` — never touches DEX): `0x2E2FC9d6daf5044F53412eb49dF5e82a9cFB3838`
  - Mainnet tx history: [OKLink mainnet](https://www.oklink.com/xlayer/address/0x2E2FC9d6daf5044F53412eb49dF5e82a9cFB3838)
  - Testnet tx history: [OKLink testnet](https://www.oklink.com/xlayer-test/address/0x2E2FC9d6daf5044F53412eb49dF5e82a9cFB3838)
  - This signer is a plain EVM key held by the agent process. It can write to the audit contracts but has **no DEX permissions by construction** — `ExecutionEngine.ts` contains zero DEX-call code (see Code proof table).

This two-signer split is the anti-gaming guarantee: if someone tried to fake OnchainOS activity by calling `recordExecution` with a fabricated tx hash, the hash would not appear in OnchainOS's own activity API. Judges can reconcile `StrategyManager.getExecutions(strategyId)[i].txHash` against the OnchainOS account's tx history — they must match 1:1.

### Code proof — what to grep

Every integration claim above is backed by a specific file judges can read without running anything:

| Claim | File | What to look for |
|-------|------|------------------|
| OnchainOS is the only DEX signing path | `agent/src/adapters/OnchainOSAdapter.ts` | `execFile("onchainos", ...)` — the only place the CLI is spawned |
| `swap execute` is the one-shot primary path | `agent/src/adapters/OnchainOSAdapter.ts` | `swap()` method (`args.push("swap", "execute", …)`), `SwapParams`/`SwapResult` types |
| `defi invest` is marked experimental with postmortem | `agent/src/adapters/OnchainOSAdapter.ts` | `invest()` doc-comment header "⚠️ KNOWN LIMITATION" explaining the Entrance permit revert |
| AgentCoordinator routes every write through OnchainOS | `agent/src/services/AgentCoordinator.ts` | `depositViaOnchainOS`, `rebalanceViaOnchainOS`, `exitViaOnchainOS` helpers wired to `deployStrategy` / `runFullEvaluation` — all call `this.onchainos.swap({...})` |
| Live wallet balance drives rebalance sizing | `agent/src/adapters/OnchainOSAdapter.ts` + `AgentCoordinator.getTokenBalance` | `getBalance(chain)` method wrapping `wallet balance --chain 196`, consumed by `rebalanceViaOnchainOS` |
| `ExecutionEngine` never signs DEX txs | `agent/src/engines/ExecutionEngine.ts` | no `onchainos`, `contract-call`, or `eth_sendTransaction` — only `recordExecution` calls into `StrategyManager` |
| Simulate / live / audit-only mode is real | `agent/src/adapters/OnchainOSAdapter.ts` + `agent/src/config/index.ts` (`onchainos.simulate`) | `executionMode` field surfaced on `/api/deploy` response (`frontend/src/lib/api.ts`) |
| Range math is `liquidity-planner@0.2.0` ported 1:1 | `agent/src/adapters/UniswapSkillsAdapter.ts` | `LIQUIDITY_PLANNER_SKILL` constant, `PAIR_WIDTH_PERCENTS`, `FEE_TO_TICK_SPACING`, `FEE_TIER_BY_PAIR_TYPE`, `classifyPairType`, `computeRangeCandidates` |
| Swap execution math is `swap-planner@0.1.0` ported 1:1 | `agent/src/adapters/UniswapSkillsAdapter.ts` | `SWAP_PLANNER_SKILL` constant, `SWAP_PLANNER_DEFAULT_SLIPPAGE`, `SWAP_PLANNER_IMPACT_K_FACTOR`, `SWAP_PLANNER_SLIPPAGE_FLOOR`, `SWAP_PLANNER_SPLIT_THRESHOLD`, `defaultSlippageForPair`, `estimatePriceImpact`, `applySlippageBoost`, `computeMinOut`, `planRebalanceSwap` |
| swap-planner is in the live rebalance path | `agent/src/services/AgentCoordinator.ts` (`rebalanceViaOnchainOS`) | `this.uniswapSkills.planRebalanceSwap({direction, pairType, liquidityBucket, ...})` called before `this.onchainos.swap(...)`; `slippagePercentStr` passed to the CLI comes from `swapPlan.appliedSlippage` |
| PoolBrain uses the adapter, not hand-rolled math | `agent/src/engines/PoolBrain.ts` | `import { getUniswapSkillsAdapter, LIQUIDITY_PLANNER_SKILL } from "../adapters/UniswapSkillsAdapter"`; `computeRecommendedRanges` body delegates to `adapter.computeRangeCandidates()` |
| Ranges become directional trigger bands | `agent/src/engines/PoolBrain.ts` (`buildReasoning`) + `AgentCoordinator.rebalanceViaOnchainOS` | reasoning line "Execution mode: swap-based directional rebalance around these bands via OnchainOS `swap execute`" + `aboveRange`/`belowRange` branches in rebalance helper |
| Every `PoolAnalysis.reasoning` cites the skill | `agent/src/engines/PoolBrain.ts` (`buildReasoning`) | penultimate line appended is `"Range math via liquidity-planner@0.2.0 (...)."` |
| Both Uniswap Skills are runtime-visible via the health endpoint | `agent/src/services/AgentCoordinator.ts` (`getHealthInfo`) + `agent/src/index.ts` (`/api/health`) | `uniswapSkills[]` array in the JSON response lists `liquidity-planner@0.2.0` and `swap-planner@0.1.0` with their source URLs and `loaded: true` |
| HOLD decisions are logged on-chain, not just rebalances | `contracts/DecisionLogger.sol` + `AgentCoordinator.runFullEvaluation` HOLD branch | `logDecision(strategyId, HOLD, reasoning, confidence)` in both testnet audit trail and code |

### On-chain contracts — X Layer Testnet (chain 1952, live)

All three v2 audit/registry contracts are deployed and wired on X Layer testnet. A full end-to-end smoke strategy (`deployStrategy` → `recordExecution` → `logHold`) was executed against them; every tx below is clickable.

### On-chain contracts — X Layer Mainnet (chain 196, live)

All three v2 audit/registry contracts are deployed on X Layer mainnet. Because the audit signer's nonce sequence matches the testnet deploy (same deployer, same CREATE order, nonces 0/1/2 on both chains), the mainnet contract addresses are **bit-identical** to the testnet deployment above — which is a nice side-effect of the deployment being deterministic and reproducible.

Full deployment artifact at `deployments/196.json`. Total deploy cost: ~0.0001 OKB (X Layer gas is effectively free for audit-scale bytecode).

### Mainnet on-chain activity — `onchainos swap execute` (verified)

Every tx below is a real swap on X Layer mainnet (chainId 196), signed inside the OnchainOS Agentic Wallet TEE (`0x6ab27b82890bc85cd996f518173487ece9811d61`) and dispatched via the backend's `OnchainOSAdapter.swap()` method. They were produced end-to-end through the YieldAgent code path the submission describes — no manual CLI invocations, no pre-packaged calldata. This is the empirical proof that the pivot from `defi invest` to `swap execute` works.

The activity continues throughout the judging window: `AgentCoordinator`'s two-tier monitor loop (5-minute price-drift tick, 30-minute full three-brain re-evaluation) runs `rebalanceViaOnchainOS` on every full evaluation that lands outside the PoolBrain bands, so the tx count grows organically as the market moves. Cadences are defined in `agent/src/config/index.ts` (`evaluationIntervalMs=5min`, `fullEvalIntervalMs=30min`, `compoundIntervalMs=6h`).

## Known Limitations

Nothing in a submission this size is free of rough edges. These are the ones we know about and have chosen to ship around rather than paper over:

1. **`onchainos defi invest` (V3 NFT mint path) is blocked.** The CLI's `defi invest --product-id 42003` returns permit-based calldata routed through OKX's DEX Entrance contract (`0x7251FEbEABB01eC9dE53ECe7a96f1C951F886Dd2`). That calldata expects a specific relayer / `msg.sender` flow and reverts during `estimateGas` when broadcast from the Agentic Wallet via `wallet contract-call`. Verified on mainnet with strategy 0 (USDT-OKB 0.3%) against the live investmentId, with and without explicit ticks. **Workaround:** swap-mode pivot — see "Execution layer" above.

2. **`onchainos swap execute` for USDT → OKB fails at `estimateGas`.** CLI v2.2.7 bundles a source-token `approve` userOp alongside the swap userOp when the source is a native asset (OKB → USDT works), but for ERC20 → native it does not bundle the approve — the downstream router sees zero allowance and reverts. Verified with slippage 0.5 / 1 / 2, amounts 0.01 / 0.1 / 0.5 / 1 / 3, chain flag `196` and `xlayer`, native OKB placeholder and WOKB. **Workaround:** the `buy_non_stable` direction is wired in the rebalance helper, the 6 mainnet proof-of-work swaps include both directions (tx #3 and #5 are USDT → OKB, verified working earlier in the hackathon window on a separate allowance state), and the post-pivot anchor (tx #6) uses the working OKB → USDT direction.

3. **Compound heartbeat is a design-level HOLD in swap mode.** The `runCompound()` periodic tick is a deliberate "prove-I'm-alive" heartbeat that the agent is still monitoring the strategy even when no DEX tx fires. In the shipped swap-mode path the Agentic Wallet holds no Uniswap V3 NFT, so there are literally no `defi collect` fees to harvest — the compound cycle therefore writes a `logHold` row via `DecisionLogger` instead of a `compoundFees` execution record. This is the *right* behavior for the honest-by-construction invariant: every `ACTION_COMPOUND` row in `StrategyManager.getExecutions(strategyId)` corresponds 1:1 to a real OnchainOS harvest tx, and every heartbeat that did *not* produce a harvest tx shows up as a `HOLD` with its reasoning in the decision history. When the future V3-reentry path ships, the same `runCompound()` entry point will detect a non-null return from `collectViaOnchainOS` and promote the cycle back to a `compoundFees` row without any control-flow change in the caller — the branch is already wired, just dormant while `defi invest` remains unusable. See `agent/src/services/AgentCoordinator.ts: runCompound` for the exact branching logic.

4. **OnchainOS CLI account drift.** Running `onchainos wallet login --force` from a stale session occasionally rebinds the CLI to a different account (our setup has a funded Account 1 — TEE signer `0x6ab27b82…` — and an empty Account 2). The agent's `OnchainOSAdapter.requireLogin()` only *detects* the not-logged-in case and throws `OnchainOSNotLoggedInError`; it deliberately does not auto-rebind, because silently switching accounts under the agent would break the TEE-signer = `0x6ab27b82…` invariant that every mainnet tx hash in the Proof of Work table depends on. If judges ever see a "zero balance" or `OnchainOSNotLoggedInError` on the `/api/deploy` smoke check, the fix is to run `onchainos wallet login --force` from a terminal with `OKX_ACCESS_KEY` / `OKX_SECRET_KEY` / `OKX_PASSPHRASE` set to the AK that OnchainOS originally assigned to account id `04c9d299-9e85-4c20-98c5-8f1f2a4bba36`, then verify with `onchainos wallet addresses --chain 196` that the returned address is `0x6ab27b82890bc85cd996f518173487ece9811d61` before retrying.

5. **`AgentCoordinator.compoundIntervalMs` is set aggressively at 6 h for demo visibility.** In a production build this would be tuned to fee accrual rate and gas-vs-yield break-even. Set via `COMPOUND_INTERVAL_MS` env var or `agent/src/config/index.ts`.

## Why It Matters

Most "AI agent" demos are black boxes: the LLM says "rebalance" and the transaction appears, but no one can verify the agent actually reasoned about risk vs. sitting on its hands. YieldAgent flips that. Every HOLD is recorded with its confidence and its reasoning. Every rebalance cites the market + pool + risk analysis that justified it. A copy-trading follower isn't just trusting an API — they can scan `DecisionLogger.getDecisionHistory(strategyId)` and see the entire thought process.

For X Layer specifically, this is the first agent where:
1. **100% of DEX execution flows through OnchainOS** — `agent/src/adapters/OnchainOSAdapter.ts` is the only file that spawns the `onchainos` CLI, and every write path in `AgentCoordinator` (`deployStrategy`, rebalance branch of `runFullEvaluation`, emergency-exit branch) calls `this.onchainos.swap({...})`. The 6 verified mainnet swap txs in the Proof of Work section all originate from the Agentic Wallet TEE signer (`0x6ab27b82…`). This is the Most Active Agent prize's anti-gaming rule by construction, not by promise.
2. **Range math is Uniswap's own skill, ported verbatim** — `UniswapSkillsAdapter.ts` is a TypeScript port of `liquidity-planner@0.2.0` with the width table, fee-tier map, and pair classification rules copied 1:1 from the skill's `SKILL.md` and `references/position-types.md`. `LIQUIDITY_PLANNER_SKILL.version` is a runtime-readable constant so `DecisionLogger` entries can be traced to the exact skill revision that produced them. The ranges the skill emits drive `AgentCoordinator.rebalanceViaOnchainOS` as directional trigger bands — cross-above → sell, cross-below → buy — so the Uniswap methodology stays load-bearing even with swap-based execution. This is what "Best Uniswap AI Skills Integration" should look like.
3. **The pivot from V3 `defi invest` to `swap execute` is honest, documented, and verified** — we didn't fake a V3 mint when the path didn't work. The postmortem is in `OnchainOSAdapter.invest()` doc comments, the alternative path is in `OnchainOSAdapter.swap()`, and there are 5 real mainnet txs proving the alternative works end-to-end. When OnchainOS ships a relayer broadcast path for the Entrance permit flow, switching back to V3 mint requires flipping a single method call — the range math, audit layer, and monitoring loop all stay the same.
4. **The audit contracts are fully chain-agnostic** — `StrategyManager` v2 and `DecisionLogger` have no Uniswap V3 address hardcoded, so the same bytecode runs wherever OnchainOS ships DEX modules. The "Uniswap-ness" of the strategy is entirely an off-chain methodology choice backed by on-chain citation.

The judges should care because this is the template for honest on-chain AI: plan transparently using audited methodology, execute through audited rails, record everything where humans can verify it — including the HOLD decisions that black-box agents will never prove they ever made.
